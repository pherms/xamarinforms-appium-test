# Xamarin Forms with Appium UI Test Automation

Using C# and Appium, this project attempts to automate UI testing of a Xamarin Forms App, with a single test code base in mind.
The beauty of using C# is that you can use the same Visual Studio IDE and obviuosly the power of C# in your UI Tests.

## Roadmap ##

- Compare this with a Java based Appium Test against the same Simple App
- Compare with a Xamarin based UI Test

## Steps ## 

- See [Appium Getting Started Guid](http://appium.io/docs/en/about-appium/getting-started/)
- Install Appium Doctor
```
npm install appium-doctor -g
```
- Make sure all the tests pass from appium-doctor
- run Appium
- Deploy the applications for Android and iOS as per usual from the IDE
- Take note of your installed Similator/Emulator names and update the InitAppiumOptions method in TestLoginPage_iOS and TestLoginPage_Droid respectively
